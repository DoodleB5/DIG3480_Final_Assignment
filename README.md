**Modifications Made:**
Our major modification was adding an invisibility feature to the JohnLemon player. With the press of the SPACE bar, the player can make themselves invisible, indicated by the light blue glow around the player's body. When invisible, the player will not be caught by the enemies. The invisibility stays on for around 5 seconds, and then there is around an 8-second recharge period before the player can use it again.

**Biggest Challenge:**
My biggest challenge was getting the original mesh to turn off completely when invisibility turns on, leaving only the blue, glowing outline of the character. This would have made the invisibility feature clearer to the player and would have looked cool visually, as if the player were really in stealth mode. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to script that, so I just made the glowing outline more visible on JohnLemon's body. I also struggled to make it so that his whole body would glow and not just the head and hands, but I was soon able to figure that out.

**Continue Working On Assignment:**
I might work more on the project to help build up my portfolio, though I'm not completely sure yet. If I add more modifications to the project, I will likely try to implement a point system with items the player must collect to find their way out without getting caught. I could also add more to the level build, making the map bigger with additional rooms and hallways, adding more enemies and tasks as well.
